You turn over a pair of aces. So does your opponent. The dealer counts the side cards for a second — then pushes the whole pot to *them*. ==r:Same pair. How did you lose?==

I have watched that exact moment stall more games than any other rule: someone half-stands, the dealer taps the felt, and the whole table waits for an explanation. Here it is. Every tie in Texas Hold'em is settled by one fixed procedure that sits one level below the [poker hand rankings](/en/blog/holdem-hand-rankings) — the rankings tell you *which hand* wins; tie-breaker rules tell you *which player* wins when both hands are the same rank.

Most of the work is done by one card: the ==**kicker**==. The full definition — which hands have one and how many — lives in [what is a kicker in poker](/en/blog/holdem-kicker "thumb:/images/holdem-kicker-hero.webp"). This guide is the *procedure*: exactly how ties are broken for the same pair, two pair, trips, straights and flushes — and the fifth card everyone forgets.

## How Are Ties Broken in Poker? The 3-Step Order

**Ties are broken in a fixed order: compare hand rank first, then the cards that make the hand, then the kickers from highest to lowest — and if all five cards still match, the pot is split.** Every showdown runs the same three checks:

<div style="background:rgba(255,248,210,0.10);border:1px solid rgba(255,240,180,0.35);border-radius:14px;padding:4px 20px 20px;margin:24px 0">

| Step | Compare | Detail |
|:---:|---|---|
| **1** | Hand rank | The higher category always wins (a flush beats a straight, etc.) |
| **2** | The cards that make the hand | Same rank? The higher pair / trips / top card wins |
| **3** | Kickers, highest first | The first difference wins the pot |

</div>

If step 1 settles it, you never reach step 2. If step 3 runs out of cards, the hands are identical and ==g:the pot is split== — how the chips are then divided (odd chips, three-way chops, side pots) is [split pot rules](/en/blog/holdem-split-pot-rules) territory. Steps 2 and 3 are where the arguments happen, so that's where we're going.

## Who Wins if Two Players Have the Same Pair?

**The higher first kicker wins. One pair uses three kickers, compared one at a time from the top — the first difference decides the pot.**

Take the hand in the photo above:

<div style="background:rgba(255,248,210,0.10);border:1px solid rgba(255,240,180,0.35);border-radius:14px;padding:16px 20px;margin:20px 0">

**Player A:** A♠ K♦  ·  **Player B:** A♥ 9♣
**Board:** A♦ Q♠ 7♥ 3♣ 2♦

| Player | Best Five | Kickers | Result |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
| A | A♠ A♦ ==g:K♦== Q♠ 7♥ | ==g:K==-Q-7 | **Wins** |
| B | A♥ A♦ ==r:Q♠== 9♣ 7♥ | ==r:Q==-9-7 | Loses |

</div>

Same pair of aces, so the kickers go head-to-head in order: ==g:K beats Q — fight over.== B's nine is still *in* the hand as the second kicker, but the comparison never gets that far.

Notice B's top kicker is the **board's** queen, not the 9 they're holding. ==r:A kicker only counts if it actually lands in your best five== — a higher board card pushes your hole card down the list. It's also why the second card you start with matters as much as the ace itself: A-K and A-9 are both "a pair of aces" here, and only one of them wins ([starting hands chart](/en/blog/holdem-starting-hands-chart)).

## Poker Tie-Breaker Rules for Every Hand

**Each hand rank has its own comparison order — some go to kickers, others are settled entirely by the cards that make them.** The badge shows whether a kicker comes into play:

:::tiebreak
Royal Flush|Always a tie (split pot)|-No kicker
Straight Flush|Highest card only|-No kicker
Four of a Kind|Quad rank → 5th card|+Kicker
Full House|Trips rank → pair rank|-No kicker
Flush|Compare all 5, high to low|+Kicker
Straight|Highest card only|-No kicker
Three of a Kind|Trips rank → 2 kickers|+Kicker
Two Pair|High pair → low pair → kicker|+Kicker
One Pair|Pair rank → 3 kickers|+Kicker
High Card|Compare all 5, high to low|+Kicker
:::

The three rows that cause the most table arguments:

- **Trips use two kickers, top one first.** On a board of A♣ A♥ 7♦ 5♣ 2♠, a player with A♠ J♠ makes A-A-A-==g:J==-7 and beats A♦ 10♦'s A-A-A-==r:10==-7 — the jack outranks the ten, and the shared 7 is never even checked.
- **Full houses have no kicker.** Trips rank first, then the pair: K-K-K-A-A beats K-K-K-Q-Q on the pair.
- **Flushes compare all five cards — ==r:never suits==.** An ace-high flush beats a king-high flush; identical ranks split. The full matchup (and the boards that fool people) is in [does a flush beat a straight](/en/blog/holdem-flush-vs-straight).

---

## Who Wins if Both Players Have Two Pair?

**Compare the higher pair, then the lower pair, then the single kicker — in that order.** Two pair carries exactly one kicker, so after the pairs themselves there's only one card left to argue about.

On a board of **K♦ 9♣ 9♠ 5♦ 2♥**, K♠ Q♦ makes K♠ K♦ 9♣ 9♠ ==g:Q♦== and K♥ J♥ makes K♥ K♦ 9♣ 9♠ ==r:J♥==. Same kings-and-nines, so the lone kicker settles it: ==g:queen over jack.==

Then there's the trap that decides real money — ==r:**counterfeiting**==:

<div style="background:rgba(255,248,210,0.10);border:1px solid rgba(255,240,180,0.35);border-radius:14px;padding:16px 20px;margin:20px 0">

**You:** 5♠ 4♠  ·  **Opponent:** A♣ K♦
**Flop:** 5♦ 4♥ K♣ — your two pair (fives and fours) leads their pair of kings
**Turn 9♠, river 9♥** — final board 5♦ 4♥ K♣ 9♠ 9♥

| Player | Best Five | Hand |
|--------|-----------|------|
| You | ==r:9♠ 9♥== 5♠ 5♦ K♣ | Nines and fives — your fours are gone |
| Opponent | K♦ K♣ 9♠ 9♥ A♣ | **Kings and nines — wins** |

</div>

The board pairing nines handed *both* players a better second pair — your fours got ==r:counterfeited==, and the only comparison left was top pair: kings over nines. The hand that led the flop loses the pot without either player improving their own cards.

## Can You Have a Higher Straight? (Where the Wheel Ranks)

**Yes — straights are ranked purely by their top card, and the ace-low wheel is the lowest straight in the game.**

On a board of 4♦ 3♣ 2♠ K♦ Q♥, a player with A♠ 5♠ makes the wheel: 5-4-3-2-A. A player with 6♥ 5♥ makes 6-5-4-3-2. ==r:The ace plays *low* in a wheel==, so A-2-3-4-5 sits at the very bottom of the straight ladder — ==g:the six-high straight wins.== Two straights with the same top card are identical, and identical hands split.

Two things the wheel does *not* do: the ace can't wrap around the middle (Q-K-A-2-3 is nothing), and it can't be high and low at once. Flushes follow the parallel rule — all five cards compared from the top, suits irrelevant — with the details over in [flush vs straight](/en/blog/holdem-flush-vs-straight).

---

## Does the 5th Card Matter in Poker?

**Yes — whenever the first four cards of two hands are identical, the fifth card is the whole pot.**

Board **A♥ K♣ Q♦ 4♣ 2♥**, and it's A♠ 8♠ against A♦ 7♦. Both have a pair of aces. First kicker: the board's K — tie. Second kicker: the board's Q — tie. Third kicker: ==g:8 beats 7.== The literal fifth card of the hand just decided everything above it.

The same logic runs quads-on-board pots: everyone shares four cards, so the fifth is the entire showdown. And it runs high-card and flush ties, where every card down to the last one is compared. The fifth card only stops mattering when the board outranks it — which is the last piece of the puzzle.

## When Your Kicker Doesn't Play — and the Pot Splits

![Infographic: the board A-K-Q-J-10 is the best five for everyone, so a 9-7 hand cannot beat it and the pot is split](/images/holdem-tiebreak-best5.webp "Best five of seven: when the board is already the best hand, your hole cards fall out of it")

**If your hole cards can't crack the board's own best five, they don't play — and when that's true for everyone, the pot is split.**

Take the board above: A♠ K♥ Q♣ J♦ 10♠, Broadway already complete. Your 9♥ 7♠ *does* make a straight — K-Q-J-10-9 — but it's **lower** than the ace-high straight sitting on the felt, so your best five is the board itself. So is everyone else's.

The subtler version is when your hand plays but your kicker doesn't. Board A♥ K♣ Q♦ J♠ 9♥: A♠ 3♠ against A♦ 2♦. Both pair the ace, and both kicker slots fill from the board — A-A-K-Q-J for each player. The 3 and the 2 are dead weight; identical best fives, ==g:chop.==

![Infographic: on an A-K-Q-J-9 board, A-3 and A-2 both play A-A-K-Q-J, so the identical hands split the pot](/images/holdem-tiebreak-split.webp "When best fives match rank for rank, the pot is divided — suits never break the tie")

Spotting these runouts before the river bet is a skill of its own — that's [reading the board](/en/blog/holdem-reading-the-board). And what happens to the chips once hands tie — equal shares, the odd chip, three-way chops, all-in side pots — is all in the [split pot rules guide](/en/blog/holdem-split-pot-rules "thumb:/images/holdem-split-pot-hero.webp").

## FAQ

**Q. How are ties broken in poker?**

A. In a fixed order: hand rank first, then the cards that make the hand (the higher pair, trips, or top card), then the kickers from highest to lowest. If all five cards match in rank, the pot is split — suits are never used.

**Q. Who wins if two players have the same pair?**

A. The player whose best five has the higher kicker. One pair carries three kickers, compared from the top down — the first difference wins the pot. If all three match, it's a split.

**Q. Who wins if both players have two pair?**

A. Compare the higher pair first, then the lower pair, then the single kicker. Aces-and-threes beats kings-and-queens, because the top pair is checked before anything else.

**Q. Does the 5th card matter in poker?**

A. Yes. When the first four cards of both hands are identical, the fifth card decides the whole pot — a pair's third kicker, a flush's lowest card, the side card to quads on the board. It only stops mattering when the board's cards outrank your hole card.

**Q. Can you use an ace as a 1 in poker?**

A. Yes, but only in the A-2-3-4-5 straight (the "wheel"), where it plays as the lowest card — which makes the wheel the lowest straight in the game. The ace can't wrap around the middle: Q-K-A-2-3 is not a straight.

**Q. Can you have a higher straight than another player?**

A. Yes — straights are ranked purely by their top card, so 6-5-4-3-2 beats the A-5 wheel, and Broadway (A-K-Q-J-10) beats them all. Equal top cards mean identical straights and a split pot.

**Q. Do suits ever break a tie in Texas Hold'em?**

A. No. There is no suit ranking in Hold'em — if two best five-card hands match rank for rank, the pot is split regardless of suits.

**Q. What happens if both players have the exact same hand?**

A. The pot is split equally — a "chop." How the chips are physically divided, who gets the odd chip, and how side pots are settled is covered in the [split pot rules](/en/blog/holdem-split-pot-rules).

## The Takeaways

1. Every tie runs the same procedure: ==**hand rank → made cards → kickers → split**== — no exceptions, no suits.
2. A kicker only counts if it ==g:makes your best five== — board cards can replace it, and a double-paired board can counterfeit your two pair entirely.
3. Straights rank by their top card (the wheel is the lowest), flushes compare all five — and when nothing separates the hands, the pot is chopped.
